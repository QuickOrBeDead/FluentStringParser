Experimenting with fast, narrow use case, string parsing.

Add a reference and

  using FluentStringParser;

to your code to get start.

Start compose a parser with

  FStringTemplate.TakeUntil<MyObject>(...)
  FStringTemplate.SkipUntil<MyObject>(...)
  FStringTemplate.MoveN<MyObject>(...)

you can chain calls to build more interesting parsers

  FStringTemplate
    .SkipUntil<MyObject>(":=")
    .TakeUntil<MyObject>(";", _MyObjectProp)

Parsers can only set fields and properties on reference types,
and only primitive number types, DateTimes, and strings can
be parsed at this time.

Else and TakeRest are available only as the second or later
directives in a parser.  Only one of each may appear in a 
single parser.

Else can only appear as the last directive to a parser.

Once finished composing, create a delegate for actual use
by calling Seal().

Seal() returns an Action<string, MyObject>, allowing for
the reuse of scratch objects.
